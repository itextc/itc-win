# IslƒÅmic Text Copier
This is a simple text copying program. The goal of this app is simple; give the user easy access to commonly used Arabic texts on their PC, such as Subhanahu wa Ta'ala and Sallallahu Alayhi wa Salam.

# Contributions
I decided to open-source this program so that anyone can contribute to it, like fixing bugs and adding more texts. It is programmed entirely in Python, so make sure you have that installed on your PC.
