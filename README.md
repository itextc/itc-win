# IslƒÅmic Text Copier
This is a simple text copying program. The goal of this app is simple; give the user easy access to commonly used Arabic texts on their PC, such as Subhanahu wa Ta'ala and Sallallahu Alayhi wa Salam.

# Contributions
I decided to open-source this program so that anyone can contribute to it, like fixing bugs and adding more texts. It is programmed entirely in Python, so make sure you have knowledge of it and have it installed on your PC.

To setup ITC, you'll need to have a few Python modules already installed, like Pyperclip, Tkinter, Keyboard, ctypes and pyglet.

To build ITC, you'll need Auto PY to EXE, and import the build config that is included in the source code.
