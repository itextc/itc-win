# Islāmic Text Copier
This is a simple text copying program. The goal of this app is simple; give the user easy access to commonly used Arabic texts on their PC, such as Subḥānahu wa Taʾālá and Sallá Allāhu ʿAlayhī wa as-Salam.

The release can be downloaded at it's official home page: https://itc.nasiratif.net.

# Contributions
I decided to open-source this program so that anyone can contribute to it, like fixing bugs, adding more texts and fine-tuning my sloppy code :). It is programmed entirely in C++.

To setup the ITC source, you'll require Visual Studio 2019, and add an `include` and `lib` folder in the project directory with the SFML files inside (https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php).

The Inno Setup source is also included (you will need to change the directories inside however).

بارك الله فيك
